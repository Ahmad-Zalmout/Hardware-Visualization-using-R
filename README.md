# Introduction

In this document different generations of CPUs and GPUs are analysed in order to help anyone who is in the market for a PC build whether for gaming, content creation, or heavy workloads.

All plots and charts you see in this document are made using R programming language.

Kindly note that this is **not** a comparison of the latest hardware rather, it is based on a data set that was taken from Kaggle. For further reference, refer to the page of the data set on the following link: [Computer Hardware Dataset (kaggle.com)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dilshaansandhu/general-computer-hardware-dataset)

# Objective

As we all know, building a PC can be quite cumbersome and tedious, and most definitely not budget friendly. So any bad choice would cost money time, and effort.

Moving a step further in helping to choose the right components for your need, check out this document that will (hopefully) help you decide or at least give an idea on what to look for in the stores.
